# GCP component-wise cheatsheet [WIP]
### While working on GCP, you will mainly encounter 4 command line utilities to achieve whatever the hell you want to:
* `gcloud`: for working with Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and many GCP services
* `gsutil`: for working with Cloud Storage
* `kubectl`: for working with GKE and Kubernetes
* `bq`: for working with BigQuery
